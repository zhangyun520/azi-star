# azi（purple）-star
 Stop arms, promote culture bright; The Purple Star shines in heaven’s light. Each common man bears duty’s call; One word alone can raise up tall. No king, no emperor to rule the frame; He comes from fields, the first by name. Read well the old books, deep and long; One word spoken, wisdom shines strong.
